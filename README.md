The Health Management System is a Python-based program designed to assist users in tracking and managing health-related data for individuals. 
The system provides two primary functionalities: logging and retrieving health information.

Users are presented with a terminal based menu that allows them to choose between logging new health data and retrieving previously recorded information. 
The system supports tracking both diet and exercise activities for each individual. The client data is stored in separate text files.

For logging health data, users can select a client and specify the type of activity (diet or exercise). They are prompted to input relevant details, such as the food consumed or the duration of exercise. The system records the timestamp along with the provided information and appends it to the respective client's file.

On the retrieval side, users can choose a client and the type of activity they wish to retrieve (diet or exercise). The system then displays the historical data recorded in the corresponding text file for the selected client and activity.

To enhance user experience and streamline the interface, the system employs a single while loop for input validation. The code structure has been organized into functions for modularity, and a systematic approach ensures efficient handling of user inputs.
